## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-08

First tagged release.

### Agents
- `architect` — language-agnostic systems architect; writes designs/ADRs, never code.
- `php-developer`, `php-reviewer` — PHP 8.3+ builder and reviewer.
- `python-developer`, `python-reviewer` — Python 3.11+ builder and reviewer.

### Skills
- `php-patterns`, `python-patterns`.

### Installers
- `install.sh` (bash) and `install.ps1` (PowerShell): local + remote (tarball) modes, user/project scope.
- Auto-discovery — every agent `.md` and skill dir in the repo is installed; no list to maintain.
- Backups to timestamped dir outside `agents/`/`skills/` so Claude Code never loads a `.bak` duplicate.
- Receipt-driven uninstall (see [ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-name-keyed-install-set-as-uninstall-manifest.md)): removes only files it installed and you haven't modified.
- `VERSION` file and `--version` / `-Version` reporting.
